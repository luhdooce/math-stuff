### Notes

Multiplication must all be done explicitly (using asterisk '\*' sign). Implicit multiplication through 
the juxtaposition of two terms will not work. If you wish to multiply 3 by the result of 6+7, your input must be '3\*(6+7)'.

Arguments for mathematical functions must be contained in parentheses. For example, 'sin6' will not work; you must input 'sin(6)'. 

There is absolutely zero ✨error-handling✨ so avoid entering errors
